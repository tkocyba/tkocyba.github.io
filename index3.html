<p><b>A little bit about me.</b></p>
<p>Hello! I am the proud owner of<I> Kocyba Kafé.</I> I am a sophomore at the University of Maine, studying at the <A HREF="http://umaine.edu/business"> Maine Business School </A>.As I finish my last two years here, I have created a business to pay for my student loans. I have loved and worked in the restaurant industry for as long as I can remember, and I am passionate about cooking. My vision for Kocyba Kafé is to create quality food with unique tastes, and to have a comfortable place to relax. We are located in Bangor to keep it local, and it is a great place to sit down and study. I am mixing the college life with afforable, and delicious food.</p>
